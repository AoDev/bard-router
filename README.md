**More than just a routing solution, for React/Mobx applications**.

## Features summary

* Router with a `very simple API`, and `navigation hooks`.
* React components `<Link/>` and `<Route/>` that observe the router state and react accordingly.
* A collection of plugins to make your life easier (history, window title, scroll, vms).

## The name

> In medieval Gaelic and British culture, a **"bard"** was a story teller.  They would talk about the people's journey in the world. A user interacting with an aplication is like a journey that the router allows to take, tell and remember.

## Install

```
npm install bard-router -DE
```
